                Sputnik 2 is one of the most famous space missions in the world, it was the space mission that involved
                Laika the dog, the first creature to be launched into space<sup><a href={"#2"} className={"reference"}>2</a></sup>.
                This mission was to retrieve information about how long a living creature could live in space.
                It was believed that Laika would live in space for 10 days and then return but an
                unfortunate circumstance caused her to die approximately 2 days into the mission due to a temperature
                issue.  This temperature issue was caused when some of the thermal insulation was torn loose,
                causing the cabin Laika was in to heat up to over 100 degrees.

                healthy.  The dogs Strelka and Belka were launched into space and returned, alive, one day later proving
                that living creatures could go into space and return safely.

                pressures that the inside of the spacecraft would feel to help to determine if life would be able to
                take to space and to study the gasses that existed in space.  Luna 1 determined that the Moon had no
                magnetic field and the Earth did.  It also observed the first solar winds from space. Luna 1 eventually
                went into orbit around the sun, also becoming the first spacecraft to orbit the sun, between the orbits
                of the Earth and the moon.  It is assumed that Luna 1 was meant to crash into Earth but it did not,
                that did not occur until Luna 2 later in 1959.

                 Luna 2 landed near the Aristides, Archimedes, and Autolycus craters.  This mission confirmed the
                conclusion drawn from Luna 1 that the moon had no magnetic field and also determined that the moon
                had no evidence of radiation belts in the moon.  It also ran experiments about the behaviors of gas
                in space as it released clouds of colored sodium gasses that allowed for the tracking of the
                spacecraft from earth.

                successfully launched Mercury Redstone 2, the first spacecraft that had a chimpanzee on it.
                The purpose of this was to determine if humans were able to survive in space after the dog tests as
                a chimpanzee is closer to a human than a dog would be.  Mercury Redstone 2 determined that the
                chimpanzee was able to work and concentrate during the flight, allowing for the hopefully ability
                for humans to eventually go into space and be able to run things from up there.

                The purpose of this mission was to determine the effects of weightlessness a human would experience
                and because of this, the spacecraft was piloted from the ground for the safety of the human.  The
                mission lasted approximately 2 hours and following reenter, the human was meant to eject safely with
                a parachute instead of landing, which he did and was safely returned.

                the spacecraft launched into space with one mission, to be the first people on the moon.  While there,
                the astronauts conducted many experiments, including collecting information about the makeup of the moon
                and taking photos of the crater that the spacecraft landed in. There is, however, a conspiracy that
                Apollo 11 did not actually land on the moon and was produced by the US government as a way to pursue
                the USSR to stop the race to the moon.  This is due to the fact that there were no stars in the sky
                from the moon photos and the fact that the flag was waving when the moon had very little atmosphere
                and therefore should have no breeze.<sup><a href={"#10"} className={"reference"}>10</a></sup>

                that coined the term “Houston We Have A Problem” as this is what the astronauts said to mission control
                when it was determined there were issues.  The space mission decided not to land on the moon, and
                instead returned safely to Earth and became the first space mission that had astronauts return
                safely after a malfunction.
